        <h1>Our Story:</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            GameHub was founded by Lars Gameson, a lifelong gamer whose passion
            for gaming began in 1995. From the early days of pixelated classics
            to the modern era of immersive digital worlds, Name's love for video
            games has been a constant. His dream was to create a platform where
            gamers of all backgrounds and platforms could come together to
            discover, buy, and enjoy games at reasonable prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driven by this passion, Name founded GameHub with the goal of making
            gaming accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for everyone. Today,
            GameHub stands as a testament to that dream—a digital platform that
            serves the gaming community with an ever-growing library of titles,
            exclusive deals, and a commitment to excellence.
